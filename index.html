                            <p class="mb-0"><br>Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, or digital currency, like donuts in Simpsons Tapped Out, Gold in Candy Crush Saga, or Vbucks in Fortnight. There are two key differences though. First, Bitcoin is intended to be used as a common-day currency used to purchase common items, replacing modern-day currencies. The second difference is blockchain technology, where every transaction is fully public and verifiable. This means you can view every transaction taking place on the Bitcoin blockchain. A blockchain is resistant to modification of any data, making them secure by design. They’re also decentralized, meaning no one person controls the blockchain, giving power to users, and allowing them to control and send their funds worldwide with no third parties.<br><br></p>

                    <p>1)&nbsp;<br>The invention of the blockchain for Bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server.<br><br>2)&nbsp;<br>There are no banks or other third parties that control how you store and send money, you take full ownership.<br><br>3)<br>And it’s a worldwide currency, which could rid the need for conversions and globalize currency.<br><br></p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Extra Information</h2>
                    <p><br>Bitcoin is being replaced by Monero for illegal activities.<br><br><br>Bitcoin is not anonymous, but there are ways to make it very difficult to track where it came from. For example, you can buy Bitcoin with cash in-person using an ATM, and send it to a new wallet, which isn’t tied to any previous transactions giving you decent anonymity.<br><br><br>Another method of making Bitcoin relatively anonymous is by using a mixer, essentially a laundering service. There are several options but coinmixer.se seems decent, and bitblender.io seems better since it requires Tor to use.<br><br><br>Another method of getting Bitcoin anonymously is by mining it yourself. Mining will require a GPU or miner, using something like Nicehash. I made a tutorial on mining and how to get started on my channel.<br></p><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Echo-Alternativen.png">
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Tips and Tricks</h2>
                    <p><br>Before going out and buying cryptocurrencies, remember to secure them. This space is very new, there are lots of scams out there, and people are losing their money left and right. Avoid leaving your coins on exchanges, transfer them to a wallet where you have control of the private keys. If you want the utmost security, you should go pick up a Ledger Nano or other hardware wallet, which is considered the most secure method of storing cryptocurrencies.<br><br></p><a href="#"></a>
